# Modnite Server
Modnite Server was a private server for Fortnite Battle Royale. I grabbed the source before it was taken down and then after a year I "fixed" it and somewhat got it to work on chapter 2

# FAQs
### What can I do with a private server?
At this time, Modnite Server lets you:
* Get to the lobby
* Equip anything you want

### How do I create an account?
Just make sure the Auto Login Feature is disabled in the config file and then type in the command window, "create" followed by the username and password.

### How do I access this on Fortnite?
Use one of the countless SSL Bypasses/Injectors. I'm not going to support any issues with this.

### Your Code is bad
I didn't try to make it good. I just wanted it to work.

### Why don't the Skins auto update after each update?
I'm lazy.
